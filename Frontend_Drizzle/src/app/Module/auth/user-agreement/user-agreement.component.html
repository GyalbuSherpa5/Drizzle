        your
        use of DRIZZLE Services as described below, which includes access to and/or applications for financing with
        monthly
        payments (“Monthly Payment Plans”) from Lenders on the DRIZZLE platform, and your access to your DRIZZLE Account

        1.3, you must be a resident of the Nepal or territories thereof to be eligible to use DRIZZLE Services.
        Unless otherwise specified, this Agreement applies to you as a Nepal resident, regardless of where you
        are
        temporarily located. Using the DRIZZLE Services means that you have accepted all of the terms and conditions
        contained in this Agreement and the agreements on the Legal Agreements page including the&nbsp;<a
          href="https://legal.DRIZZLE.com/privacy/en-us">Privacy Policy</a>, the&nbsp;<a

        this
        Agreement, as applicable.</p>
      <p><b>1. The Agreement.</b></p>
      <p><b>1.1 The Parties to this Agreement.</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Financing through DRIZZLE.</b></p>
      <p><b>For all states not expressly listed below,</b>&nbsp;this Agreement describes the terms between DRIZZLE ("we",
        "us", “DRIZZLE” or "our") and you ("you", "your", "User", "DRIZZLE User") for the financing provided by DRIZZLE to
        you for the goods and/or services you purchased from the retail or online merchants that offer DRIZZLE as a
        payment
        method (“DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant”). Through this Agreement, DRIZZLE has extended you financing and the right
        to
        defer payment for the goods and/or services you have purchased. You agree to pay DRIZZLE pursuant to the terms of
        this Agreement.</p>
      <p><b>For Residents of Nevada and New Mexico,</b> this Agreement describes the terms of the retail installment
        sale
        contract between you ("you", "your", "User", "DRIZZLE User") and the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant, the creditor,
        who
        sold you the goods and/or services and the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant’s assigns (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We have
        extended you financing and the right to defer payment for the goods and/or services. You agree to pay us
        pursuant
        to the terms of this retail installment contract. You also agree that this retail installment contract will be
        assigned to DRIZZLE once you purchase the goods and/or services.</p>
      <p><b>b. Financing through Lender(s).</b></p>
      <p>A Lender is a third-party creditor that may offer Monthly Payment Plans via the DRIZZLE platform and, upon your
        acceptance of terms presented in a separate agreement between you and the Lender (“Credit Agreement”), finance
        your purchases. To the extent there are inconsistent terms between the Credit Agreement and this User Agreement,
        the Credit Agreement, including its arbitration provisions, will control.</p>
      <p>Lender, its service providers, and assignees will provide you notices, disclosures, communications, and
        separately obtain certain authorizations and consents applicable to your Monthly Payment Plan (“Lender Notices”)
        including but not limited to your payment schedule, authorizations for automatic payments, consent to electronic
        communications, and privacy policies. To the extent there are inconsistent terms between such Lender Notices and
        this User Agreement, the Lender Notices will control.</p>
      <p><b>1.2 Changes to this Agreement.</b></p>
      <p>DRIZZLE may unilaterally decide to change this Agreement from time to time, including, other than for Monthly
        Payment Plans, your Spending Power, provided, however, that such changes will not impose additional obligations
        on
        you concerning actions you had taken before the change became effective unless you specifically agree to such
        changes. You accept and agree to the changes to this Agreement by continuing to use DRIZZLE Services.
        Accordingly,
        please review this Agreement on a periodic basis. If you do not accept any amendment to the Agreement, you must
        cease using the Services immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are located in a jurisdiction at the
        time at which this Agreement is entered into that requires your consent to any changes to this Agreement, any
        such
        changes with respect to the Services provided by DRIZZLE or your obligations under this Agreement will not take
        effect until you have provided affirmative consent to such changes.</p>
      <p><b>1.3 Your Eligibility.</b></p>
      <p>To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old, a resident of the Nepal or any
        territories thereof, and fully competent to enter into this Agreement and comply with its terms. You represent
        and
        warrant that you are eligible to use the Services.</p>
      <p><b>1.4 Patriot Act Disclosure. </b>To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
        activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that on
        personal accounts identifies each person who opens an account. In addition, on legal entity accounts, we will
        require identification on beneficial owners and controlling person.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other
        information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other
        identifying
        documents.</p>
      <p><b>2. What is DRIZZLE?</b></p>
      <p><b>2.1 DRIZZLE Services.</b></p>
      <p>DRIZZLE is a payment processing platform designed to allow Users to finance and buy products from merchants
        today
        and pay for them later, through a down payment followed by installment payments (“Order”) or apply for a Monthly
        Payment Plan to finance a purchase. To start using DRIZZLE, you need to open a DRIZZLE Account.</p>
      <p><b>2.2 Your Promise to Pay.</b></p>
      <p>Before completing any Order on your behalf through any DRIZZLE Services, DRIZZLE will secure your promise to pay
        for each Order by disclosing all terms and conditions applicable to that Order and securing your affirmative
        consent to those terms for that Order, including your promise to pay the amount of the goods and services
        financed
        by the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant or DRIZZLE (“Promise to Pay”). When you submit an Order and Promise to Pay,
        these
        terms are not binding on DRIZZLE until accepted by DRIZZLE. DRIZZLE’s acceptance of your Promise to Pay will be
        evidenced by a return email from DRIZZLE to your email indicating that your Order and related financing has been
        approved.</p>
      <p>By accepting this Agreement and confirming the financing of any purchases through the DRIZZLE Authorized
        Merchant
        or DRIZZLE, you give DRIZZLE the right to collect any unpaid portions of the financed purchase. All User fees
        incurred from late payments or account reactivation and rescheduled payments are solely for the purpose of: (i)
        keeping your DRIZZLE Account active; and (ii) you seeking to reschedule a payment; neither fee is required as
        part
        of your Promise to Pay. DRIZZLE does not charge fees for late payments or account reactivation and rescheduling
        payments where prohibited by law.</p>
      <p>For Monthly Payment Plans, refer to your Credit Agreement and applicable Lender Notices.</p>
      <p><b>2.3 Your Account.</b></p>
      <p>To become a User of the DRIZZLE Services, you must create a DRIZZLE User Account (aka “DRIZZLE Account” or “your
        Account”). By opening a DRIZZLE Account and accepting the terms as outlined in this Agreement, you attest that
        you
        are establishing your Account to enable yourself to finance the purchase of goods and services from DRIZZLE
        Authorized Merchants.</p>
      <p><b>2.4 Account Security and First Time Activation.</b></p>
      <p>DRIZZLE does not charge to activate an Account for the first time.</p>
      <p>DRIZZLE identifies User Accounts by the mobile phone number linked to the User Account. We use 2-factor
        authentication to secure your Account. The first factor is a Personal Identification Number or PIN. This number
        is
        created by you and can be changed at any time in your Account Profile. The second factor we use is a One Time
        Password ("OTP") sent via Short Message Service ("SMS") text to your mobile phone number. The OTP proves that
        you
        have possession of your mobile phone number and the device you are using with DRIZZLE Services. DRIZZLE uses
        device
        identification techniques and algorithms to remove the need for the OTP when we recognize a previously
        identified
        and approved device.</p>
      <p>To create a DRIZZLE User Account, we require that you provide us with your mobile phone number and prove that
        you
        have possession of that device by entering an OTP. We then ask you to create a PIN and identify yourself. User
        identification properties that we ask for include, but are not limited to, first and last name, address, and
        date
        of birth. You agree to provide your mobile phone number and ensure that we have your current mobile phone
        number.
        You confirm that you hold the mobile phone number you have entered or that you have the DRIZZLE User Account
        holder’s permission to use the service.</p>
      <p><b>BY PROVIDING YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER TO US, YOU PROVIDE YOUR PRIOR EXPRESS CONSENT FOR US AND OUR SERVICE
        PROVIDERS TO SEND DRIZZLE OTP TEXTS TO YOUR NUMBER USING AN AUTODIALER FOR THE PURPOSES RELATED TO ADMINISTRATION
        OF THE SERVICES.</b></p>
      <p><b>2.5 DRIZZLE’s Role in the Order.</b></p>
      <p>DRIZZLE is not engaged in the sale of any goods or services financed by DRIZZLE or Lenders. DRIZZLE does not have
        control of, or liability for, the products or services financed through the DRIZZLE Services. We provide a
        service
        that allows you to finance your purchase from DRIZZLE Authorized Merchants. If you have a dispute with a DRIZZLE
        Authorized Merchant, DRIZZLE provides a dispute resolution service in the DRIZZLE Account dashboard to aid in your
        dispute process.</p>
      <p><b>2.6 Canceling Transactions.</b></p>
      <p>a. All requests for Orders and Services through DRIZZLE are subject to approval by DRIZZLE, at our discretion. We
        may choose not to approve an Order, provide financing or display an option for financing through a Lender, for a
        product to you, or we may cancel an approved Order before the goods or services are delivered or supplied, if:
        (i)
        we reasonably consider such cancellation necessary in order to: (A) protect the integrity of our systems or the
        products; (B) prevent fraud; (C) limit the risk of money laundering or terrorism financing; or (D) otherwise
        protect us against legal, regulatory or non-payment risk; (ii) you do not pass our verifications or checks;
        (iii)
        we suspect, or are aware, that you have breached this Agreement in a material respect (including by failing to
        make any payment due under this Agreement on the payment due date); or (iv) we otherwise reasonably consider the
        Order or request for financing to be suspicious.</p>
      <p>b. If we cancel an approved Order or request for financing: (i) we will apply a full refund of any amounts you
        have paid to us to your bank account or card used for payment, and will cancel any future payments related to
        that
        Order; and (ii) you will have no obligation to make any further payments to us, and will not have any other
        ongoing relationship with us, with respect to that Order. Further, should we cancel an approved Order or request
        for financing, the Merchant will not be obliged to deliver the goods for that Order, unless required to do so by
        law. If you wish to proceed with the purchase from the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant, the DRIZZLE Authorized
        Merchant
        may accept an alternative payment method in its discretion, or if required to do so by law.</p>
      <p><b>2.7 Automatic Payments. (Note: This Section 2.7 does not apply to Monthly Payment Plans)</b></p>
      <p><b>By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you authorize and direct DRIZZLE to make preauthorized electronic
        fund transfers from your designated account or payment device to pay for your Order.</b></p>
      <p><b>a. Payment Schedule.</b>&nbsp;Once we approve the financing for your Order, you will receive an email from
        us
        with confirmation of receipt of your Order, your Promise to Pay, and a Payment Schedule. This email is
        confirmation that you have agreed to make regularly-scheduled payments. You agree to make payment(s) in
        accordance
        with the Payment Schedule. You may prepay the full outstanding balance or make early payments through your
        DRIZZLE
        Account without any penalty otherwise, you must make the payments in the amounts and by the dates shown in your
        Payment Schedule. If you make a prepayment and it causes your final payment to be less than the amount under the
        Payment Schedule, we will only process a payment for the lesser amount. If you enroll a payment method in any of
        the electronic payment channels (described below), you authorize DRIZZLE to process such payments using the
        payment
        method details provided by you (“Payment Method”). YOU CAN UPDATE OR CHANGE YOUR PREFERRED PAYMENT METHOD AT ANY
        TIME VIA YOUR DRIZZLE ACCOUNT. An ‘Automatic Payment’ is a payment, through the Payment Method you have chosen,
        that we will automatically process and collect and includes both Recurring Payments (for all amounts that you
        owe
        DRIZZLE) or Pre-Scheduled Payments (for specific amounts, on specific dates). This 'Payment Method' can be a bank
        account or payment card. This Payment Method can be charged on a one-time or regular basis in agreed upon
        amounts
        as outlined in your Payment Schedule and depending on the payment channel. You will have the option to select a
        preferred Payment Method when your DRIZZLE Account is being created. As described below (see Section 6), <b>certain
          payment methods have fees associated with those payments</b>. You can also process payments in-person or by
        sending a check for your payment. These fee-free methods are also described below.</p>
      <p><b>b. Authorization.</b> Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, if you enroll in Automatic Payments, you
        hereby expressly consent to, authorize, and instruct DRIZZLE to process and collect Automatic Payment amounts
        using
        any Payment Method on file, beginning with your preferred Payment Method. You acknowledge that you are giving us
        the ability to reverse payment amounts from or to this bank account or card, in accordance with your Payment
        Schedule and the terms of this Agreement. You authorize DRIZZLE, at its discretion, to process multiple card
        payments, including credit card, debit card, or prepaid card, for the same card due on the same date as one
        transaction or as separate transactions for both the initial processing attempt and any additional attempts for
        a
        failed payment. You also authorize us to satisfy any monetary liability you owe us by:</p>
      <p>Processing and collecting the payment using any of your preferred Payment Methods on file with us at a later
        time(s) or date(s);</p>
      <p>Processing and collecting the payment using any other Payment Method which you have provided details of;</p>
      <p>Offsetting the payment amount against any amounts we may owe to you; or</p>
      <p>Any other legal means.</p>
      <p><b>c. Recurring Authorization to Automatically Process Payments for All Amounts Due. </b>You can enroll a bank
        or
        credit union account for automatic bank drafts (ACHs) for all amounts that you owe to DRIZZLE for Automatic
        Payments. If you choose this option, DRIZZLE will debit your enrolled bank or credit union account for all
        amounts
        due for that Order. This amount will automatically be collected on the dates due as shown in your Payment
        Schedule
        unless these dates and amounts are updated because of refunds, cancellations, delayed shipments by the merchant,
        or for other reasons. If you owe amounts to DRIZZLE other than those shown in your Payment Schedule or if the
        date
        or amount that the debit will be processed is different from the amount set forth in your Payment Schedule, we
        will notify you in accordance with our <a href="https://legal.DRIZZLE.com/electronicdelivery/en-us">e-Communications
          Policy</a> at least ten Business Days before the date will process the debit. If you wish to cancel your
        enrollment in automatic recurring payments, you must login and update your Payment Method at least three
        Business
        Days before the next automatic recurring payment is scheduled to process. If you owe any amounts to DRIZZLE and
        these amounts are past due, DRIZZLE will include these amounts in your recurring debit. If your payment is
        returned
        for insufficient funds, you will be responsible for any fees incurred and DRIZZLE will have no liability with
        respect to these amounts. If we are unable process your payment and you did not make a one-time payment to cover
        the amount owed, DRIZZLE may make up to two additional attempts to collect a failed payment. If these attempts
        are
        unsuccessful, DRIZZLE may attempt to collect your late payment on the next recurring payment date along with the
        payment that is due on that date. If these attempts are unsuccessful, DRIZZLE reserves the right to collect these
        payments using all Payment Methods on file. <b>There is no fee for the use of this service.</b></p>
      <p><b>d. Pre-Scheduled Payments for a Fixed Amount</b>. Under this option, you can enroll to pay a fixed amount
        according to a schedule that is set at the time of Order (i.e., using a credit or debit card). This amount will
        be
        automatically paid on the dates that you set when you schedule these payments. (If a scheduled date falls on a
        weekend, we reserve the right to make your payment on the Friday before. If a scheduled date falls on a federal
        bank holiday, we may process your payment the day before, or the Friday before if the federal bank holiday is a
        Monday). <b>There is a fee for this service to pay by Pre-Scheduled Payments for a Fixed Amount.</b> This fee
        will
        be disclosed to you before you enroll for Pre-Scheduled Payment for a Fixed Amount. These fees are explained in
        Section 6 (Fees) of this Agreement. Before using the “Pre-Scheduled Payments” service, you should consider other
        fee-free methods of making your payment such as recurring authorizations for payments, payment by check, or
        payment through your bank or credit union’s bill pay service (although you should understand if your bank or
        credit union charges a fee for this service).</p>
      <p><b>e. Pay by Check or Card (In-Person).</b> You may also make a payment by check or card in the Minneapolis,
        Minnesota area. Checks may be mailed to DRIZZLE 700 Nicollet Mall, Suite 640, Minneapolis, MN 55402. Or you may
        bring your card to our office located at 700 Nicollet Mall, Suite 640, Minneapolis, MN 55402. There is no fee
        for
        the use of this service. We are working to provide additional locations for in-person payments in the future.
      </p>
      <p><b>f. Down Payments.</b> To allow immediate purchase and processing of your Order, we require the use of a
        debit
        or credit card. By providing this card number and information to DRIZZLE, you authorize DRIZZLE to charge or debit
        your designated card for your down payment when the merchant processes the Order with DRIZZLE. This payment may
        be
        processed immediately after you place your Order, but no later than 20 Days after you place the Order. <b>There
          is
          no fee for the use of this service.</b></p>
      <p><b>g. One-Time Payments.</b> You authorize us to charge or debit your designated Payment Method for any
        one-time
        payment(s) you initiate. This applies to both one-time payments by card and one-time payments by automatic bank
        draft (ACH). Any payment made prior to 6:00 pm CT will be applied that Day. Any payments made after 6:00 pm CT
        will be applied the following Business Day. There may be a fee associated to these payments. The fees will be
        disclosed to you before you authorize this one-time payment. If your payment is returned for insufficient funds,
        you will be responsible for any fees incurred and DRIZZLE will have no liability with respect to these amounts.
      </p>
      <p><b>h. Return of Double Payments.</b> If you have enrolled in Automatic Payments by enrolling a debit/credit
        card
        or bank account as a preferred Payment Method but elect to also mail a paper check to DRIZZLE, there is a
        potential
        that the Automatic Payment will process before we receive your paper check. (<b>For this reason, we suggest that
          you send paper checks at least 7 to 10 Days before the payment due date on your Payment Schedule</b>).
        Automatic
        payments, whether by automatic bank draft (ACH) or card, may process at any time on the date you have scheduled
        (or provided in a notification to you). If we receive a mailed paper check on or before the date a payment is
        due
        under your Payment Schedule, we will attempt to stop the Automatic Payment. If we are unable to stop the
        processing of the Automatic Payment, we will notify you and coordinate to return the paper check to you, reverse
        the Automatic Payment, or otherwise destroy the paper check. DRIZZLE does not accept “double payments” without
        specific instructions from you that you are making a prepayment or overpayment and will work to cancel, reverse,
        or return one of the payments should this scenario occur.</p>
      <p><b>i. Sufficient Funds Required.</b> You are responsible for ensuring that you have sufficient funds in your
        bank/credit union account for automatic bank drafts, sufficient funds in your checking account for debit card
        payments, or sufficient credit available for credit card payments in order to make Automatic Payments on the
        dates
        specified in your Payment Schedule or in notices that DRIZZLE provides to you showing payment dates and amounts.
        You are liable for any fees or charges imposed by your Payment Method, except to the extent that such fees or
        charges arise as a result of our error or system failure. If you cannot make a payment or know that you have
        insufficient funds, you must provide us reasonable notice of at least 3 Business Days to change the Payment
        Method
        or payment date.</p>
      <p><b>j. Error Correction.</b> If we make an error regarding a payment made by any method other than a check, you
        must notify us within 60 Days of receiving your statement from us. If we are timely notified, we will correct
        the
        error and reimburse you any fees or charges improperly imposed as a result of our error or system failure. To
        file
        a claim, email support@DRIZZLE.com. Please provide us with a copy of the relevant records so we can locate your
        Account and identify the issue.</p>
      <p><b>k. Automatic Bank Draft (ACH) Payments.</b> You understand that any payment authorization on your bank or
        credit union account is to remain in full force except as changed as otherwise permitted hereunder.</p>
      <p><b>l.</b> Reserved.</p>
      <p><b>m. Validation by Processing Financial Institution.</b> You acknowledge that your financial institution is
        not
        required to verify that any purpose of payment for which a pre-authorized debit has been issued has been
        fulfilled
        by us or that a pre-authorized debit has been issued in accordance with the particulars of this Agreement,
        including, without limitation, the frequency and amount of the pre-authorized debits authorized under this
        agreement, as a condition to honoring a pre-authorized debit issued by us on the account you have provided us.
      </p>
      <p><b>n. Revocation.</b> You may revoke Payment Authorizations for your Payment Method(s) on file provided that
        DRIZZLE has received written notification from you that you are revoking such authorization at least seven (7)
        Business Days prior to your scheduled Payment Date. To revoke your payment authorization, you must email us at

        you to print, sign and return to DRIZZLE. A wet signature is required, and Digital Signatures will not be
        accepted.
        A wet signature is a traditional pen-and-ink signature. For the purposes of this policy, faxed signatures and
        non-electronic signatures included in PDF files will be considered wet signatures. You understand that revoking
        a
        payment authorization does not eliminate your obligation to repay any amounts you may owe to DRIZZLE.</p>
      <p><b>2.8 Account Deactivation and Reactivation.</b></p>
      <p>If you have outstanding amounts owed to us for an Order that have not been paid according to your Payment
        Schedule, including any adjustments for any agreed upon rescheduled payments, then DRIZZLE has the right to
        deactivate your DRIZZLE Account following any applicable grace period as described in Section 6.1. Upon
        deactivation, you may still login to your DRIZZLE Account; however, you will not be able to make additional
        purchases using DRIZZLE’s Services until you have reactivated your DRIZZLE Account. After deactivation, you are
        still required to make payment for each Order according to your Payment Schedule and this Agreement. You can
        reactivate your DRIZZLE Account by voluntarily paying us: (i) all unpaid payments owed to us for each Order
        according to your Payment Schedule, as adjusted; and (ii) any outstanding Account Late Payment Fees. We will
        attempt to process Failed Payments and collect any related Late Payment Fees by using the Payment Methods you
        have
        provided us. While we encourage all Users to satisfy their payment obligations and to seek to return to good
        standing with DRIZZLE, it remains in our sole and absolute discretion if and when any account will be reactivated
        based upon our internal guidelines and regulatory mandates. Where prohibited by law, DRIZZLE does not charge fees
        for late payments or Account reactivation and rescheduling payments.</p>
      <p><b>2.9 Authorization to Credit Your Account.</b></p>
      <p>In some cases, such as a refund or a service credit, DRIZZLE may be required to submit a payment to your bank
        account or card on file. You grant DRIZZLE the right to perform these payments to your account(s) on file with
        us.</p>
      <p><b>2.10 Right of Set Off for Outstanding Amounts.</b></p>
      <p>If for any reason DRIZZLE receives a credit for you or return of your funds from a merchant and you still owe
        any
        amount outstanding with us, DRIZZLE reserves the right to apply that credit or those returned funds to any
        outstanding amounts instead of returning those funds to you. You agree that DRIZZLE may, in its discretion, apply
        the credit or the funds to outstanding amounts you have with us in any order and for any outstanding
        payments.</p>
      <p><b>3. Using DRIZZLE.</b></p>
      <p><b>(Note: Subsections 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 do not apply to Monthly Payment Plans)</b></p>
      <p><b>3.1 Purchases.</b></p>
      <p>You can use DRIZZLE to pay for purchases of goods and services from DRIZZLE Authorized Merchants by using DRIZZLE
        functionality on DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant sites and interfaces. Except for Monthly Payment Plans, payment
        mechanisms for your down payment and installment payments may include but are not limited to, bank accounts,
        credit cards, and debit cards. If a bank account is used as your selected Payment Method, you are requesting an
        electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, DRIZZLE will make electronic transfers from
        your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that you grant authorization to DRIZZLE to make the
        transfers from any of your bank account(s), debit card(s) and/or credit card(s) to fulfill your down payment,
        installment payments (as may be adjusted), a missed or failed payment, and any fee payments. You give DRIZZLE the
        right to resubmit any transaction you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds or any
        other reason. For Monthly Payment Plans, refer to your Credit Agreement and applicable Lender Notices.</p>
      <p><b>3.1.1 Spending&nbsp;Power.</b></p>
      <p>“Spending Power” means your ability to purchase an item based on your financial status with DRIZZLE, as
        determined
        by DRIZZLE in its discretion and displayed in your DRIZZLE Account, which may change from time to time. You agree
        that you will not use&nbsp;DRIZZLE to&nbsp;purchase any item&nbsp;(other than via “Pay-in-Full”) at any location&nbsp;when
        the proposed transaction is greater than the current amount of your Spending&nbsp;Power at the time of such
        transaction.&nbsp;Where a transaction (other than via “Pay-in-Full”) is greater than your current Spending
        Power,
        the transaction will not be approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DRIZZLE may, in its discretion, approve such
        a
        transaction that is above your Spending Power. You further acknowledge that such&nbsp;Spending Power&nbsp;is
        predicated upon your current financial status with DRIZZLE given your Account balance as a result of outstanding
        purchases, current payments, pending or failed transactions, how recently you used your DRIZZLE Account to make a
        purchase, and/or&nbsp;any other factor which DRIZZLE considers in the good faith assessment of your shopping
        limit.
        Spending Power may change at any time pursuant to DRIZZLE's sole and reasonable discretion.</p>
      <p><b>3.2 Purchase Size Limits.</b></p>
      <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the number of Orders you can have open at any given time as well as
        Order amount minimums and maximums for each Order attempted using DRIZZLE Services.</p>
      <p><b>3.2.1 Minimum Order Value.</b></p>
      <p>DRIZZLE’s minimum Order value is subject to change at any time and can differ based on the payment plan
        available
        and can vary by merchant. For Nepalese. Users, DRIZZLE requires a minimum Order value of twenty dollars ($20) per
        transaction for standard pay-in-4 Orders. For DRIZZLE Card Users, DRIZZLE will process any Orders placed using the
        DRIZZLE Card below twenty dollars ($20) for the full Order amount at time of processing. If a Merchant splits
        your
        Order into multiple shipments, DRIZZLE will process any of the split shipments of less than twenty dollars ($20)
        for the full split shipment amount. In addition to DRIZZLE’s limits, Merchants may have their own minimum Order
        value.</p>
      <p><b>3.3 Refused and Refunded Transactions.</b></p>
      <p>When you make a purchase financed by DRIZZLE or a Lender, the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant is not required to
        accept
        your payment. You agree that you will not hold DRIZZLE or the Lender liable for any damages resulting from a
        DRIZZLE
        Authorized Merchant’s decision not to accept a payment made through the DRIZZLE Services. Subject to Section 2.10
        (Right of Set Off for Outstanding Amounts), any unclaimed, refunded or denied payment, other than one from a
        virtual card, will be returned to the original Payment Method. As may be applicable, we will return any
        unclaimed
        payment to you within 30 Days of the date you initiated payment. In the event of a virtual card refund, such
        refund may not be applied to the original payment method as it may be applied to any open Order or any other
        card
        on file. Similarly, if we are unable to tie a refund to an Order, we will apply the refund directly to any card
        on
        file.</p>
      <p>For Monthly Payment Plans, refer to your Credit Agreement and applicable Lender Notices.</p>
      <p><b>3.4 Payment Review.</b></p>
      <p>Payment Review is a process by which DRIZZLE reviews certain potentially high-risk transactions. If a payment is
        subject to Payment Review, DRIZZLE will place a hold on the payment and provide notice to you and the Merchant.
        DRIZZLE will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the payment. If the payment is cleared, DRIZZLE will
        provide notice to you and the Merchant. Otherwise, DRIZZLE will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned
        to you, the User.</p>

        provided
        under applicable law. A Late Payment Fee will be applied one time for each Failed Payment and, to the extent

        PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS
        BOTH
        YOU AND DRIZZLE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S
        CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
      <p><b>14.3.2 Arbitration Procedures.</b></p>
      <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators
        instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, the arbitrator(s)
        can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. The
        arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of this User Agreement as a court would. All issues are for the
        arbitrator(s) to decide, except those issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this
        Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of subsection (14.3.1) of this Agreement to Arbitrate
        (“Prohibition
        of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), shall be for a court of competent
        jurisdiction to decide.</p>
      <p>For the Nepal, the arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under
        its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this
        Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A party who intends to seek arbitration
        must
        first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to DRIZZLE
        should be sent to DRIZZLE, Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 700 Nicollet Mall, Suite 640,
        Minneapolis, MN 55402. DRIZZLE will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated
        with
        your DRIZZLE Account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called
        for in the Notice must be provided including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is
        asserting and the relief sought. If you and DRIZZLE are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice
        within
        30 days after the Notice is sent, you or DRIZZLE may, with the consent of the other, initiate arbitration
        proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at www.adr.org. The
        arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value
        of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or DRIZZLE may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone
        or
        based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and DRIZZLE subject to the discretion
        of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person
        hearing is held, you and/or DRIZZLE may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator(s) require otherwise. Any
        settlement offer made by you or DRIZZLE shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator(s). The arbitrator(s) will
        decide
        the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and
        will
        honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior
        arbitrations involving different DRIZZLE Users, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the
        same DRIZZLE User to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and
        binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
        thereof.</p>
      <p><b>1. Intended Beneficiaries of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.</b></p>
      <p>An Intended Beneficiary of the arbitration provision and class action waiver may enforce them in full with
        respect to any claims between them on the one hand and you on the other arising from or in any way relating to
        this Agreement, your DRIZZLE Account, the DRIZZLE Services, our website, or your transactions or relationships
        with
        DRIZZLE or such Intended Beneficiary. Intended Beneficiaries are our agents, principals, representatives,
        directors, officers, shareholders, governors, managers and members. Intended Beneficiaries also are our parents,
        subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, licensees, attorneys, predecessors, successors, joint venturers,
        contractors,
        assigns, designees, DRIZZLE Authorized Merchants, servicers, financial institutions with which we partner,
        Lenders
        that offer credit through the DRIZZLE Services, and service providers. A service provider is any third-party
        providing us or any Intended Beneficiary any goods or services arising out of or in any way relating to this
        Agreement or your access or use of the DRIZZLE Account or DRIZZLE Services. Intended Beneficiaries include past,
        present, and future persons listed in this paragraph. The arbitration provision and class action waiver may be
        enforced by or against any person or entity purporting to bring claims on your behalf, including any agent,
        representative, executor, guardian, or trustee and by or against any Intended Beneficiary. The arbitration
        provision and class action waiver may also be enforced by or against any person or entity who acquires any right
        or interest that, but for the transfer of the right or interest, would have belonged to us or an Intended
        Beneficiary of this arbitration agreement.</p>
      <p><b>2. Costs of Arbitration.</b></p>
      <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules unless otherwise
        stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. At your request, DRIZZLE will pay as much of the filing, administration,
        and
        arbitrator fees as the arbitrator(s) deem necessary to prevent the cost of accessing the arbitration from being
        prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator(s) determine the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be
        frivolous,
        you agree to reimburse DRIZZLE for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by DRIZZLE on your behalf that
        you
        otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules. DRIZZLE will pay your reasonable attorney’s fees if
        you
        Prevail on the matter in arbitration. For purposes of this Section, “Prevail” means to be awarded at least 80%
        of
        the initial demand.</p>
      <p><b>3. Severability.</b></p>
      <p>With the exception of any of the provisions in subsection (14.3.1) of this Agreement to Arbitrate ("Prohibition
        of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), if a court decides that any part of this
        Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still
        apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in subsection (14.3.1) of this Agreement to Arbitrate
        ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief") is invalid or unenforceable,
        then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement
        will
        continue to apply.</p>
      <p><b>4. Arbitration Opt-Out Procedure.</b></p>
      <p>YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (“OPT OUT”) BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE
        (“OPT-OUT

        arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures,
        including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The
        AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other,
        by
        certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to DRIZZLE must be sent to DRIZZLE,

        opt-out
        applies. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the
        Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this Section
        will
        continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future
        arbitration agreements that you may have with us. If you opt out of arbitration, we reserve the right to
        terminate
        our relationship with you.</p>
      <p><b>5. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate.</b></p>
      <p>Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment
        to
        this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided herein) in
        the
        future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against DRIZZLE prior to
        the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the

        amended, or under any other bankruptcy or insolvency law, DRIZZLE will be entitled to recover all reasonable
        costs
        or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the enforcement of
        this Agreement.</p>
      <p><b>7. No Waiver.</b></p>
      <p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to
        subsequent or similar breaches.</p>
      <p><b>8. Indemnification.</b></p>
      <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold DRIZZLE, our parent, Affiliates and the officers, directors, agents,

        DRIZZLE Services, and/or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>
      <p><b>9. Assumption of Rights.</b></p>
      <p>If DRIZZLE pays out a Refund on a Dispute that you file against a DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant, you agree that
        DRIZZLE assumes your rights against the DRIZZLE Authorized Merchant and third parties related to the payment and
        may
        pursue those rights directly or on your behalf, in DRIZZLE's discretion.</p>
      <p><b>10. Release of DRIZZLE.</b></p>
      <p>If you have a dispute with one or more Merchants, you release DRIZZLE (and our parent, our Affiliates, and our
        and
        their respective officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers) from any and all claims,
        demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in
        any way connected with your dispute with one or more Merchant. In entering into this release, you expressly
        waive
        any protections that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you
        may
        know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</p>
      <p><b>15. General Provisions.</b></p>
      <p><b>15.1 Assignment.</b></p>
      <p>You may not transfer or assign any rights or obligations you have under this Agreement without DRIZZLE’s prior
        written consent. DRIZZLE reserves the right to transfer or assign this Agreement or any right or obligation under

      <p><b>15.2 Severability.</b></p>
      <p>Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement, if any provision of this Agreement is held by an arbitrator or a

        thereof shall be severed from this agreement, and the remaining provisions or parts thereof shall continue in
